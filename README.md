- **For the vast majority of modern phones, tablets, single board computers, and small game consoles, you'll need the `arm64-v8a` version.**

- The `armeabi-v7a` version is for older, 32-bit ARM stuff.

- The `x86_64` version is for some rare Intel/Microsoft tablets and/or for Chromebooks, and/or for running on a PC on Android-x86 or in Waydroid or similar.
